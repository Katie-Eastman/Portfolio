					<h3>Salutations! My name is Katie.</h3> 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I am an aspiring game developer currently enrolled in CWI's Software Development program. I initially became interested in coding
					due to being inspired by my friends and seeing the diversity of things that you can do with the right programming knowledge. My love of creative media and storytelling
					has been lifelong, and I hope to turn my own ideas as well as the visions of others into tangible digital experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					I moved to Idaho when I was 11 years old, and I appreciate the nature here. In my free time, I love to spend time with my husband and my friends both on and offline. 
					I enjoy playing video games, reading, writing, and doing digital art. I've been drawing since I was in middle school, and it brings me a lot of joy.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm always looking to improve my skills and to learn all that I can, and I look forward to continuing to do so throughout college and beyond. I would like to do as much 
					freelance work to add to my portfolio as possible, however I am enthusiastically open to more traditional employment as well!
